December 05, 2015 at 03:07PM|No sympathy for any pregnant female who was injured in the #PlannedParenthood #shooting that was there to get an #abortion. She deserved it.
December 05, 2015 at 03:08PM|I wonder how many unborn babies were saved by this gunman interrupting normal #PlannedParenthood activites? Just looking on the bright side.
December 05, 2015 at 03:09PM|#PlannedParenthood #shooter has done more in one day to save black babies, then #BlackLivesMatter has done in the last several months.
December 05, 2015 at 03:10PM|#PlannedParenthood kills a million babies and no one bats an eye. But 1 brave hero tries to put a stop to that, everyone loses their minds.
December 05, 2015 at 03:11PM|I am very happy that the shooter's mother chose not to abort him. #PlannedParenthood
December 05, 2015 at 03:12PM|Folks upset that murderers & murder enablers died at #PlannedParenthood but babies die at #PlannedParenthood everyday, why shouldn't adults?
December 05, 2015 at 03:13PM|We should terminate the 500,000 adult females who use #PlannedParenthood. They could have pro protected sex, but they're too slutty & lazy.
December 05, 2015 at 03:14PM|#PlannedParenthood no mention of how many babies lives were saved? Such a shame but good things often come from tragedy.
December 05, 2015 at 03:14PM|Active #Shooter Colorado #PlannedParenthood. I would think this brave HERO is saving innocent Baby lives!
December 05, 2015 at 03:14PM|It's entirely possible many innocent babies were saved from #PlannedParenthood butchers since incident began mid-day.
December 05, 2015 at 03:14PM|Think about how many innocent babies were likely saved by shutting down #PlannedParenthood. Abortion doctors are terrorists, too.
December 05, 2015 at 03:10PM|I'm thankful for that brave hero shooting up #PlannedParenthood right now. He's doing the Lord's work! Saving babies one bullet at a time!
